    "Stein (1956) found that if the dimension of data $p>=3$, then the MLE estimator $\\hat{\\mu_n}$ is inadmissible. This property is known as **_Stein's phenomenon_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with definition of inadmissible estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;**DEFINITION** (Inadmissible)\n",
    "\n",
    "> An estimator $\\hat{\\mu_n}$ of the parameter $\\mu$ is called **_inadmissible_** on $R^p$ with respect to the squared risk if there exists another estimator $\\mu_n^*$ such that\n",
    "$$E||\\mu_n^*-\\mu ||^2\\leq E||\\hat{\\mu}_n-\\mu||^2\\quad\\quad \\textit{for all }\\mu\\in R^p,$$\n",

    "&emsp;&emsp;In this case, we also call that $\\mu_n^*$ dominates $\\hat{\\mu}_n$ . Otherwise, the estimator $\\hat{\\mu_n}$ is\n",

    "According to the difinition, Stein's phenomenon can be desribed like:\n",

    "A typical choice is the James-Stein estimator given by James-Stein (1961) for Gaussian distribution. To state formally,\n",
